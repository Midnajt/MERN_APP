# MERN_APP
This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress in mastering the MERN stack. Here, you'll find all my projects, assignments, and notes from the MERN course I'm currently enrolled in.

Technologies Covered:
MongoDB 🍃: NoSQL database for storing data in a JSON-like format.
Express.js 🚀: Web application framework for Node.js.
React ⚛️: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Node.js 🟩: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine.

Feel free to explore and follow along as I dive deep into the MERN stack! Any feedback or suggestions are highly appreciated. Let's code! 💻✨
